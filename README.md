# TheStaywell

Name: Hildred N. Baker (Nikki)

Occupation: Mail Carrier and Rookie Entrepreneur

Project: "The Staywell" -- www.stayneartheark.com (domain to be hosted via AWS eventually). NOTE -- www.thestaywell.com was not available.

Project Completed For: Code Kentucky Web Development - Part 1&2 (Thursday Night Class) AND Myself!

Reason for Project: This project served dual purposes for me:

    1.  This site was needed for an Airbnb ("The Staywell") which should be up and running by April 2023.

    2.  Home computers and The World Wide Web were fairly new when I was in young, and we were never taught any kind of computer sciences.  This became a real problem for me when I hired some web developers to work on a few web/tech projects that I am trying to complete.  Thankfully, I found Code Kentucky, and in just 12 short weeks, I am able to communicate with these developers and actually understand what they are talking about.  It has made a world of difference in being able to manage and guide them in developing my projects.

Intent of Project: To provide my own independent booking site for my Airbnb and keep more of the revenue for myself.

Code Kentucky Project Requirements:

    1.  SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS that should be met in this repository:

        a.  "Use a regular expression to validate user input and inform the user about it" -- see the contactus.html page.
        b.  "Calculate and display data based on an external factor (get current date and display time remaining until an event)" -- see the
            booknow.html page.
        c.  "Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app" - see the "Google Maps API" on the index.html page.

    2.  I have worked on MANY additional features that were listed in the Project Requirements as well.  I like that the features assigned are         completely relevent to REAL WORLD applications, so before this website is launched, I should be using the following work-in-progress features too.

        a.  The Node.js server, for example, was working, then stopped working (repeat, etc.), so I was afraid to use that feature to fulfill an actual requirement of this project.
        b.  My Local Attractions (localattractions.html) page will eventually pull in json data to display a chart with Local Attractions on it, including images.
        c.  My Order Confirmation page (orderconfirmation.html) "uses a function that accepts 2 or more input parameters and returns a value that is calculated or determined by the inputs" and creates a custom confirmation number.

    3.  My project is uploaded to Gitbub (https://github.com/nikkimnik/TheStaywell.git) and has at least 5 separate commits.

    4.  This README.md file is included and has been updated.

    5.  The Staywell is a fully formed website with Header, Body Sections, and Footer.

    6.  I did my best at being semantic!

    7.  Flexbox was used.

    8.  I did my best to make it accessible!

    9.  Hopefully the project is visually appealing.  Design is my weakness, so I have a lady in Brazil who helps me with that.  For this project, I had her create a logo and I used the colors in the logo throughout the site.  credit: Ivana Giseli - ivanadesign123@gmail.com
